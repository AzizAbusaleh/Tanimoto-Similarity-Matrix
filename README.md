# Tanimoto-Similarity-Matrix
This code calculates the Tanimoto distance between chemical compounds, represented by their SMILES strings, and visualizes the results in a heatmap. The Tanimoto distance is derived from molecular fingerprints (specifically, Morgan fingerprints), and it measures the dissimilarity between molecules. A Tanimoto distance of 0 means that the molecules are identical, while a distance of 1 means they are completely different.

The heatmap is designed to handle large datasets, and the plot is smoothened using interpolation to improve visualization for large matrices.
